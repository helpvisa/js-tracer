# js-tracer
## A JavaScript-based raytracer that runs in your browser

This project is a reimplementation of [my previous raytracer in C#](https://github.com/helpvisa/simple_raytracer), created in the hopes of making the code more legible, coherent, and usable in a more exciting web-based environment.

Though the project is not yet finished, in-progress snapshots of its current state can be found at [this GitHub pages link!](https://helpvisa.github.io/js-tracer/)

This project makes use of the seedrandom.js library, which can be found on GitHub [at this link.](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom)
