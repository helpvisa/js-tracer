# js-tracer
## A JavaScript-based raytracer that runs in your browser

This project is a reimplementation of (my previous raytracer in C#)[https://github.com/helpvisa/simple_raytracer], created in the hopes of making the code more legible, coherent, and usable in a more exciting web-based environment.
